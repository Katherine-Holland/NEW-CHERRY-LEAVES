# Cherry Leaf Powdery Mildew Detection

## üìÑ **Project Overview**
This project aims to assist Farmy & Foods, an agricultural company, in automating the detection of powdery mildew in cherry leaves. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects plant health and fruit quality, posing a significant challenge for the company. The manual detection process is time-consuming and inefficient, making scalability a challenge. This project utilizes machine learning to predict whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected with powdery mildew, using images provided by the client.

The project delivers a **Streamlit dashboard** that fulfills the client's business requirements and provides a scalable, efficient solution to detect mildew.
