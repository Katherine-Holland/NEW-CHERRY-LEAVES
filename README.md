# Cherry Leaf Powdery Mildew Detection

## üìÑ **Project Overview**
This project aims to assist Farmy & Foods, an agricultural company, in automating the detection of powdery mildew in cherry leaves. Powdery mildew is a fungal disease that affects plant health and fruit quality, posing a significant challenge for the company. The manual detection process is time-consuming and inefficient, making scalability a challenge. This project utilizes machine learning to predict whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected with powdery mildew, using images provided by the client.

The project delivers a **Streamlit dashboard** that fulfills the client's business requirements and provides a scalable, efficient solution to detect mildew.

## üéØ **Business Requirements**
1. **Visual Differentiation Study**  
   Conduct a study to visually differentiate cherry leaves that are healthy from those infected with powdery mildew. This study includes:
   - Average images and variability images for both classes (healthy and infected).
   - Difference between the average healthy and infected leaves.
   - Image montages showcasing both classes.

2. **Predictive Capability**  
   Build a machine learning system capable of predicting whether a cherry leaf is healthy or infected based on an input image, achieving a minimum accuracy of 97%.

3. **Dashboard Development**  
   Develop a user-friendly dashboard where:
   - Users can upload images for live prediction.
   - The dashboard displays prediction results, probabilities, and related visualizations.
   - Summary reports can be downloaded for further analysis.

## üìÇ **Dataset**
The dataset, sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/codeinstitute/cherry-leaves), consists of **4,280 images of cherry leaves**:
- **Healthy**: Cherry leaves with no signs of infection.
- **Infected**: Cherry leaves with visible powdery mildew.

### Dataset Details:
- **Train, Validation, and Test Splits**:  
  The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets for effective model training and evaluation.
- **Preprocessing**: Images were resized and augmented to enhance model performance. Grayscale conversion was tested to optimize runtime without compromising accuracy.

## üß™ **Project Hypothesis**
The hypothesis for the project was that infected cherry leaves would exhibit:
1. **White powdery mildew patches.**
2. **Shriveled or irregular edges.**

### Validation Approach
The hypothesis was tested using:
- Visual analysis through montages, average images, variability images, and difference studies.
- Training a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify leaves as healthy or infected.
- Evaluating the model's accuracy and loss on training, validation, and test sets.

## üõ†Ô∏è **Machine Learning Pipeline**
### Key Steps:
1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Images resized to manageable dimensions (e.g., 100x100 or 256x256 pixels).
   - Experimented with grayscale conversion to optimize runtime.

2. **Model Architecture:**
   - Built using a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**.
   - Incorporated **dropout layers** and **early stopping** to prevent overfitting.
   - The **grayscale model** achieved improved runtime without sacrificing accuracy.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Accuracy and loss on training, validation, and test sets.
   - Confusion matrix to analyze false positives and negatives.
   - Performance met the 97% accuracy threshold required by the client.

4. **Deployment:**
   - Integrated the model into a Streamlit dashboard for real-time predictions.

## üîß **Unfixed Bugs**
1. **Prediction Chart Display Issue**:  
   Occasionally, the bar chart displaying prediction probabilities shows both classes, even when the result is definitive. This does not impact the accuracy but requires refinement in future iterations.
   
2. **Scalability for Multi-Class Problems**:  
   While the system performs well for binary classification, future scalability to multi-class problems will require further testing and optimization.
